# Sorting_algorithms
## Sorting algorithms program for networks and operating systems essentials course
The sorting algorithms used were:
* First come first served (FCFS)
* Shortest job first (SJF)
* Round robin (RR)
* Shortest remaining time first (SRTF)

Each algorithm was ran using three different seed values, which increased each time in order to get a variety of results for comparison

## results from testing
### Seed: 1797410758
**Average turnaround time**
From the outputs, it is seen that the Shortest remaining time first (SRTF) has the lowest average turnaround time and first come first served (SCFS) has the highest.
**Average waiting time**
From the outputs, it is seen that the Shortest remaining time first (SRTF) has the lowest average wait time and first come first served (SCFS) has the highest.
